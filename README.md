# FunctionToStochasticCircuit
This project uses stochastic logic gates to create a circuit that allows us to compute values of different mathematical functions.

## Important Information
#### Background
Horner's Expansion Scholarly Article: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26709-6 \
Double-NAND Expansion Scholarly Article DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3060403.3060410

#### Descrption
This project uses stochastic logic gates to create a circuit that allows us to compute values of different mathematical functions.

## The Software
In this GitHub Repository, there are several python files that are able to be executed to assist in generating circuit diagrams for a given function. Though functions are limited at the program's current state, it is a very useful tool for cross-checking any calculations.
